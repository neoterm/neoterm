NeoTerm packages use their own `.neo` or `.nt` extensions, and the primary command is `neo`. To install packages, use `neo use pkgname` instead of traditional commands like `apt install` or `pkg install`. Stay tuned for more on how to use these features soon!

## Development Update!
We're currently hard at work on [NeoLang](https://github.com/neolang)—our new programming language—and NeoTerm, this terminal emulator built using `NeoLang`. Crafting both simultaneously ensures top quality, though it does extend our timeline. Thanks for your patience! Exciting updates and a release are on the horizon.
